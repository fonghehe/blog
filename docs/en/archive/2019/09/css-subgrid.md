When it comes to CSS Subgrid, many developers only operate at the API-call level. This article tries to look at the practical problems and solutions you'll actually run into from a production-environment perspective.

## Basic Principles

The key is understanding the core logic:

```css
.container {
  width: min(90%, 1200px);
  margin-inline: auto;
  padding-inline: clamp(1rem, 3vw, 3rem);
}

.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min(300px, 100%), 1fr));
  gap: clamp(1rem, 2vw, 2rem);
}

.card { container-type: inline-size; }

@container (min-width: 400px) {
  .card__content { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr; }
}

```

Performance optimization needs to be tailored to the specific scenario—not every case calls for over-optimization.

## Advanced Features

We can improve things in the following ways:

```css
:root {
  --bg: light-dark(#fff, #1a1a2e);
  --text: light-dark(#333, #e0e0e0);
  --accent: light-dark(#2563eb, #60a5fa);
  color-scheme: light dark;
}

.carousel {
  display: flex; gap: 1rem; overflow-x: auto;
  scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;
  scroll-padding: 1rem;
}

.carousel__item {
  flex: 0 0 80%; scroll-snap-align: start;
  border-radius: 12px; transition: scale 0.3s ease;
}

```

This approach has been running stably in production for over half a year and has been proven in real use.

## Project Practice

Let's start with the basic implementation:

```css
.container {
  width: min(90%, 1200px);
  margin-inline: auto;
  padding-inline: clamp(1rem, 3vw, 3rem);
}

.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min(300px, 100%), 1fr));
  gap: clamp(1rem, 2vw, 2rem);
}

.card { container-type: inline-size; }

@container (min-width: 400px) {
  .card__content { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr; }
}

```

This snippet shows the basic usage. In real projects you also need to account for error handling and edge cases.

## Best Practices

Building on that, we can optimize further:

```css
:root {
  --bg: light-dark(#fff, #1a1a2e);
  --text: light-dark(#333, #e0e0e0);
  --accent: light-dark(#2563eb, #60a5fa);
  color-scheme: light dark;
}

.carousel {
  display: flex; gap: 1rem; overflow-x: auto;
  scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;
  scroll-padding: 1rem;
}

.carousel__item {
  flex: 0 0 80%; scroll-snap-align: start;
  border-radius: 12px; transition: scale 0.3s ease;
}

```

This pattern is very useful in large projects and can significantly reduce maintenance costs.

## Summary

- CSS Subgrid is not a silver bullet; choose it based on project scale and tech stack.
- Understanding the underlying principles matters more than memorizing the API.
- Always validate compatibility before using it in production.
- In team collaboration, conventions and documentation matter more than the technology itself.
