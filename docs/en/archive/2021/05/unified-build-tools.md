We recently adopted the trend toward unified frontend build tools on our team and accumulated quite a bit of experience. Here's a summary for reference, hoping it helps those doing similar work.

## Core Concepts

Let's start with the basic implementation:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'
import { resolve } from 'path'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [vue()],
  resolve: { alias: { '@': resolve(__dirname, 'src') } },
  server: {
    port: 3000,
    proxy: { '/api': { target: 'http://localhost:8080', changeOrigin: true } }
  },
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        manualChunks: {
          vendor: ['vue', 'vue-router', 'pinia'],
          utils: ['lodash-es', 'dayjs']
        }
      }
    }
  }
})

```

This code demonstrates the basic usage. In real projects, you also need to consider error handling and edge cases.

## In-Depth Analysis

Building on this foundation, we can further optimize:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: { path: __dirname + '/dist', filename: '[name].[contenthash:8].js' },
  module: {
    rules: [
      { test: /\.jsx?$/, exclude: /node_modules/, use: 'babel-loader' },
      { test: /\.css$/, use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader', 'postcss-loader'] }
    ]
  },
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      chunks: 'all',
      cacheGroups: {
        vendor: { test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/, name: 'vendors' }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

This pattern is very practical in large projects and can significantly reduce maintenance costs.

## Implementation Experience

In real projects, the usage gets a bit more involved:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'
import { resolve } from 'path'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [vue()],
  resolve: { alias: { '@': resolve(__dirname, 'src') } },
  server: {
    port: 3000,
    proxy: { '/api': { target: 'http://localhost:8080', changeOrigin: true } }
  },
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        manualChunks: {
          vendor: ['vue', 'vue-router', 'pinia'],
          utils: ['lodash-es', 'dayjs']
        }
      }
    }
  }
})

```

Through this approach, both the testability and scalability of the code are improved.

## Optimization Strategies

Here is a complete example:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: { path: __dirname + '/dist', filename: '[name].[contenthash:8].js' },
  module: {
    rules: [
      { test: /\.jsx?$/, exclude: /node_modules/, use: 'babel-loader' },
      { test: /\.css$/, use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader', 'postcss-loader'] }
    ]
  },
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      chunks: 'all',
      cacheGroups: {
        vendor: { test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/, name: 'vendors' }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

Pay attention to boundary condition handling, which is critical in production.

## Summary

- Code examples are for reference only and need to be adjusted according to your business scenario
- The shift toward unified frontend build tools is no silver bullet; choose it based on project scale and tech stack.
- Understanding underlying principles is more important than memorizing APIs
