图片 CDN 自动优化方案 is becoming increasingly widespread in frontend development. This article dives into its core principles and best practices from real projects.

## Basic Usage

We can improve it in the following ways:

```javascript
const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  for (const entry of list.getEntries()) {
    if (entry.entryType === 'largest-contentful-paint') {
      reportMetric('LCP', entry.startTime)
    }
    if (entry.entryType === 'first-input') {
      reportMetric('FID', entry.processingStart - entry.startTime)
    }
  }
})
observer.observe({ entryTypes: ['largest-contentful-paint', 'first-input'] })

```

This approach has been running stably in production for over six months and has been practically validated.

## Advanced Usage

Let's start with the basic implementation:

```javascript
FROM node:20-alpine AS deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN corepack enable && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
RUN pnpm build

FROM nginx:alpine AS runner
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

```

This code demonstrates the basic usage. In real projects, you also need to consider error handling and edge cases.

## Practical Cases

Building on this foundation, we can further optimize:

```javascript
const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  for (const entry of list.getEntries()) {
    if (entry.entryType === 'largest-contentful-paint') {
      reportMetric('LCP', entry.startTime)
    }
    if (entry.entryType === 'first-input') {
      reportMetric('FID', entry.processingStart - entry.startTime)
    }
  }
})
observer.observe({ entryTypes: ['largest-contentful-paint', 'first-input'] })

```

This pattern is very practical in large projects and can significantly reduce maintenance costs.

## Performance Optimization

实际项目中的用法会更复杂一些：

```javascript
FROM node:20-alpine AS deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN corepack enable && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
RUN pnpm build

FROM nginx:alpine AS runner
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

```

Through this approach, both the testability and scalability of the code are improved.

## Common Traps

Here is a complete example:

```javascript
const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  for (const entry of list.getEntries()) {
    if (entry.entryType === 'largest-contentful-paint') {
      reportMetric('LCP', entry.startTime)
    }
    if (entry.entryType === 'first-input') {
      reportMetric('FID', entry.processingStart - entry.startTime)
    }
  }
})
observer.observe({ entryTypes: ['largest-contentful-paint', 'first-input'] })

```

Pay attention to boundary condition handling, which is critical in production.

## Summary

- In team collaboration, conventions and documentation are more important than the technology itself
- Stay updated with the community; technical solutions need continuous iteration
- Don't adopt new technology just for the sake of it
- Code examples are for reference only and need to be adjusted according to your business scenario
- 图片 CDN 自动优化方案不是银弹，需要根据项目规模和技术栈选择
