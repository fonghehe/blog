关于Vercel 前端部署与预览环境，: many developers only stay at the API call level. This article discusses real-world problems and solutions from a production perspective.

## Basic Principles

实际项目中的用法会更复杂一些：

```javascript
FROM node:20-alpine AS deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN corepack enable && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
RUN pnpm build

FROM nginx:alpine AS runner
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

```

Through this approach, both the testability and scalability of the code are improved.

## Advanced Features

Here is a complete example:

```javascript
FROM node:20-alpine AS deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN corepack enable && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
RUN pnpm build

FROM nginx:alpine AS runner
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

```

Pay attention to boundary condition handling, which is critical in production.

## Project Practice

The key lies in understanding the core logic:

```javascript
FROM node:20-alpine AS deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN corepack enable && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
RUN pnpm build

FROM nginx:alpine AS runner
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

```

Performance optimization should be tailored to specific scenarios; not all cases require over-optimization.

## Best Practices

We can improve it in the following ways:

```javascript
FROM node:20-alpine AS deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN corepack enable && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
RUN pnpm build

FROM nginx:alpine AS runner
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

```

This approach has been running stably in production for over six months and has been practically validated.

## Summary

- Always verify compatibility before using in production
- In team collaboration, conventions and documentation are more important than the technology itself
- Stay updated with the community; technical solutions need continuous iteration
- Don't adopt new technology just for the sake of it
- Code examples are for reference only and need to be adjusted according to your business scenario
