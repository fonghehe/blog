We recently implemented React 18 useDeferredValue 延迟更新， and accumulated quite a bit of experience. Here's a summary for reference, hoping it helps those doing similar work.

## Core Concepts

The key lies in understanding the core logic:

```javascript
import { useReducer, useCallback } from 'react'

const initialState = { items: [], filter: '', sort: 'date' }

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'SET_ITEMS': return { ...state, items: action.payload }
    case 'SET_FILTER': return { ...state, filter: action.payload }
    case 'ADD_ITEM': return { ...state, items: [...state.items, action.payload] }
    case 'REMOVE_ITEM': return { ...state, items: state.items.filter(i => i.id !== action.payload) }
    default: throw new Error(`Unknown: ${action.type}`)
  }
}

```

Performance optimization should be tailored to specific scenarios; not all cases require over-optimization.

## In-Depth Analysis

We can improve it in the following ways:

```javascript
import { useReducer, useCallback } from 'react'

const initialState = { items: [], filter: '', sort: 'date' }

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'SET_ITEMS': return { ...state, items: action.payload }
    case 'SET_FILTER': return { ...state, filter: action.payload }
    case 'ADD_ITEM': return { ...state, items: [...state.items, action.payload] }
    case 'REMOVE_ITEM': return { ...state, items: state.items.filter(i => i.id !== action.payload) }
    default: throw new Error(`Unknown: ${action.type}`)
  }
}

```

This approach has been running stably in production for over six months and has been practically validated.

## Implementation Experience

Let's start with the basic implementation:

```javascript
import { useReducer, useCallback } from 'react'

const initialState = { items: [], filter: '', sort: 'date' }

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'SET_ITEMS': return { ...state, items: action.payload }
    case 'SET_FILTER': return { ...state, filter: action.payload }
    case 'ADD_ITEM': return { ...state, items: [...state.items, action.payload] }
    case 'REMOVE_ITEM': return { ...state, items: state.items.filter(i => i.id !== action.payload) }
    default: throw new Error(`Unknown: ${action.type}`)
  }
}

```

This code demonstrates the basic usage. In real projects, you also need to consider error handling and edge cases.

## Optimization Strategies

Building on this foundation, we can further optimize:

```javascript
import { useReducer, useCallback } from 'react'

const initialState = { items: [], filter: '', sort: 'date' }

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'SET_ITEMS': return { ...state, items: action.payload }
    case 'SET_FILTER': return { ...state, filter: action.payload }
    case 'ADD_ITEM': return { ...state, items: [...state.items, action.payload] }
    case 'REMOVE_ITEM': return { ...state, items: state.items.filter(i => i.id !== action.payload) }
    default: throw new Error(`Unknown: ${action.type}`)
  }
}

```

This pattern is very practical in large projects and can significantly reduce maintenance costs.

## Summary

- Always verify compatibility before using in production
- In team collaboration, conventions and documentation are more important than the technology itself
- Stay updated with the community; technical solutions need continuous iteration
- Don't adopt new technology just for the sake of it
