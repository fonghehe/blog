We recently implemented Core Web Vitals 2022 优化策略， and accumulated quite a bit of experience. Here's a summary for reference, hoping it helps those doing similar work.

## Core Concepts

Usage in real projects tends to be more complex:

```javascript
const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  for (const entry of list.getEntries()) {
    if (entry.entryType === 'largest-contentful-paint') {
      reportMetric('LCP', entry.startTime)
    }
    if (entry.entryType === 'first-input') {
      reportMetric('FID', entry.processingStart - entry.startTime)
    }
  }
})
observer.observe({ entryTypes: ['largest-contentful-paint', 'first-input'] })

```

Through this approach, both the testability and scalability of the code are improved.

## In-Depth Analysis

Here is a complete example:

```javascript
const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  for (const entry of list.getEntries()) {
    if (entry.entryType === 'largest-contentful-paint') {
      reportMetric('LCP', entry.startTime)
    }
    if (entry.entryType === 'first-input') {
      reportMetric('FID', entry.processingStart - entry.startTime)
    }
  }
})
observer.observe({ entryTypes: ['largest-contentful-paint', 'first-input'] })

```

Pay attention to boundary condition handling, which is critical in production.

## Implementation Experience

The key lies in understanding the core logic:

```javascript
const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  for (const entry of list.getEntries()) {
    if (entry.entryType === 'largest-contentful-paint') {
      reportMetric('LCP', entry.startTime)
    }
    if (entry.entryType === 'first-input') {
      reportMetric('FID', entry.processingStart - entry.startTime)
    }
  }
})
observer.observe({ entryTypes: ['largest-contentful-paint', 'first-input'] })

```

Performance optimization should be tailored to specific scenarios; not all cases require over-optimization.

## Optimization Strategies

We can improve it in the following ways:

```javascript
const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  for (const entry of list.getEntries()) {
    if (entry.entryType === 'largest-contentful-paint') {
      reportMetric('LCP', entry.startTime)
    }
    if (entry.entryType === 'first-input') {
      reportMetric('FID', entry.processingStart - entry.startTime)
    }
  }
})
observer.observe({ entryTypes: ['largest-contentful-paint', 'first-input'] })

```

This approach has been running stably in production for over six months and has been practically validated.

## Summary

- Stay updated with the community; technical solutions need continuous iteration
- Don't adopt new technology just for the sake of it
- Code examples are for reference only and need to be adjusted according to your business scenario
- Core Web Vitals 2022 优化策略 is not a silver bullet; choose based on your project scale and tech stack
- Understanding underlying principles is more important than memorizing APIs
