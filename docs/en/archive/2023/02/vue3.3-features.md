I recently applied the Vue 3.3 feature walkthrough with my team and accumulated quite a bit of experience. Here's a write-up for anyone doing similar work.

## Core Concepts

Usage in real projects tends to be more complex:

```javascript
import { ref, computed, watch, onMounted } from 'vue'

export default {
  setup() {
    const count = ref(0)
    const doubled = computed(() => count.value * 2)

    watch(count, (newVal, oldVal) => {
      console.log(`count: ${oldVal} -> ${newVal}`)
    })

    onMounted(() => { console.log('组件已挂载') })

    return { count, doubled }
  }
}

```

Through this approach, both the testability and scalability of the code are improved.

## In-Depth Analysis

Here is a complete example:

```javascript
import { reactive, toRefs, computed } from 'vue'

function useCounter(initial = 0) {
  const state = reactive({ count: initial, history: [initial] })
  const doubled = computed(() => state.count * 2)

  function increment() {
    state.count++
    state.history.push(state.count)
  }

  return { ...toRefs(state), doubled, increment }
}

```

Pay attention to boundary condition handling, which is critical in production.

## Implementation Experience

The key lies in understanding the core logic:

```javascript
import { ref, computed, watch, onMounted } from 'vue'

export default {
  setup() {
    const count = ref(0)
    const doubled = computed(() => count.value * 2)

    watch(count, (newVal, oldVal) => {
      console.log(`count: ${oldVal} -> ${newVal}`)
    })

    onMounted(() => { console.log('组件已挂载') })

    return { count, doubled }
  }
}

```

Performance optimization should be tailored to specific scenarios; not all cases require over-optimization.

## Optimization Strategies

We can improve it in the following ways:

```javascript
import { reactive, toRefs, computed } from 'vue'

function useCounter(initial = 0) {
  const state = reactive({ count: initial, history: [initial] })
  const doubled = computed(() => state.count * 2)

  function increment() {
    state.count++
    state.history.push(state.count)
  }

  return { ...toRefs(state), doubled, increment }
}

```

This approach has been running stably in production for over six months and has been practically validated.

## Summary

- Stay updated with the community; technical solutions need continuous iteration
- Don't adopt new technology just for the sake of it
- Code examples are for reference only and need to be adjusted according to your business scenario
- The vue 3.3 feature walkthrough is not a silver bullet — choose based on your project scale and tech stack
- Understanding underlying principles is more important than memorizing APIs
