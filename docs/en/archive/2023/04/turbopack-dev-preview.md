Turbopack dev-mode performance is showing up in more and more everyday development. This article systematically covers its usage, mechanics, and practical strategies.

## Quick Start

The key lies in understanding the core logic:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: { path: __dirname + '/dist', filename: '[name].[contenthash:8].js' },
  module: {
    rules: [
      { test: /\.jsx?$/, exclude: /node_modules/, use: 'babel-loader' },
      { test: /\.css$/, use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader', 'postcss-loader'] }
    ]
  },
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      chunks: 'all',
      cacheGroups: {
        vendor: { test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/, name: 'vendors' }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

Performance optimization should be tailored to specific scenarios; not all cases require over-optimization.

## Internal Principles

We can improve it in the following ways:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: { path: __dirname + '/dist', filename: '[name].[contenthash:8].js' },
  module: {
    rules: [
      { test: /\.jsx?$/, exclude: /node_modules/, use: 'babel-loader' },
      { test: /\.css$/, use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader', 'postcss-loader'] }
    ]
  },
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      chunks: 'all',
      cacheGroups: {
        vendor: { test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/, name: 'vendors' }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

This approach has been running stably in production for over six months and has been practically validated.

## Business Practice

Let's start with the basic implementation:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: { path: __dirname + '/dist', filename: '[name].[contenthash:8].js' },
  module: {
    rules: [
      { test: /\.jsx?$/, exclude: /node_modules/, use: 'babel-loader' },
      { test: /\.css$/, use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader', 'postcss-loader'] }
    ]
  },
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      chunks: 'all',
      cacheGroups: {
        vendor: { test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/, name: 'vendors' }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

This code demonstrates the basic usage. In real projects, you also need to consider error handling and edge cases.

## Performance Comparison

Building on this foundation, we can further optimize:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: { path: __dirname + '/dist', filename: '[name].[contenthash:8].js' },
  module: {
    rules: [
      { test: /\.jsx?$/, exclude: /node_modules/, use: 'babel-loader' },
      { test: /\.css$/, use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader', 'postcss-loader'] }
    ]
  },
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      chunks: 'all',
      cacheGroups: {
        vendor: { test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/, name: 'vendors' }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

This pattern is very practical in large projects and can significantly reduce maintenance costs.

## Summary

- Code examples are for reference only and need to be adjusted according to your business scenario
- Turbopack dev-mode performance is not a silver bullet — choose based on your project scale and tech stack
- Understanding underlying principles is more important than memorizing APIs
- Always verify compatibility before using in production
