I frequently use React 19: New Context API in daily work and have compiled this systematic summary, hoping to help everyone understand and apply it better.

## Basic Concepts

Here is a practical example:

```javascript
// 使用示例
import { createApp } from './app'

const config = {
  apiBase: process.env.API_BASE || '/api',
  timeout: 10000,
  retries: 3
}

const app = createApp(config)
app.mount('#root')

```

In real projects, you need to make appropriate adjustments based on specific requirements.

## Core Implementation

The core code is as follows:

```javascript
// 工具函数封装
function createHandler(options = {}) {
  const { timeout = 5000, retries = 3 } = options

  return async function execute(url, data) {
    for (let attempt = 0; attempt < retries; attempt++) {
      try {
        const controller = new AbortController()
        const timer = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), timeout)
        const res = await fetch(url, {
          method: 'POST',
          body: JSON.stringify(data),
          signal: controller.signal
        })
        clearTimeout(timer)
        return await res.json()
      } catch (err) {
        if (attempt === retries - 1) throw err
      }
    }
  }
}

```

Be sure to handle edge cases and exceptions properly.

## Practical Application

We can implement it like this:

```javascript
// 核心实现
const processData = (input) => {
  return input
    .filter(item => item.active)
    .map(item => ({
      ...item,
      displayName: item.name.trim(),
      timestamp: Date.now()
    }))
    .sort((a, b) => b.timestamp - a.timestamp)
}

```

With this pattern, the code's maintainability improves.

## Best Practices

See the following code for specific usage:

```javascript
// 使用示例
import { createApp } from './app'

const config = {
  apiBase: process.env.API_BASE || '/api',
  timeout: 10000,
  retries: 3
}

const app = createApp(config)
app.mount('#root')

```

It is recommended to unify conventions within the team to reduce inconsistency.

## Summary

- In real projects, choosing the right solution matters more than chasing the newest technology
- Keep code style consistent across the team to cut maintenance costs
- Keep an eye on community developments and update the technical approach in time
