The topic of React 19: useActionState for Form State has been discussed many times in the community, but with each new version, many conclusions need updating. This article revisits it based on the latest version.

## Getting Started

Let's start with the basic implementation:

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react'

function DataList({ endpoint, pageSize = 20 }) {
  const [data, setData] = useState([])
  const [page, setPage] = useState(1)
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)

  const fetchData = useCallback(async () => {
    setLoading(true)
    try {
      const res = await fetch(`${endpoint}?page=${page}&size=${pageSize}`)
      setData(await res.json())
    } finally { setLoading(false) }
  }, [endpoint, page, pageSize])

  useEffect(() => { fetchData() }, [fetchData])

  return <div>{loading ? <Spinner /> : <List items={data} />}</div>
}

```

This code demonstrates the basic usage. In real projects, you also need to consider error handling and edge cases.

## Source Code Analysis

Building on this foundation, we can further optimize:

```javascript
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { persist, devtools } from 'zustand/middleware'

const useStore = create(
  devtools(persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      user: null,
      theme: 'light',
      notifications: [],
      setUser: (user) => set({ user }),
      toggleTheme: () => set(s => ({
        theme: s.theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'
      })),
      unreadCount: () => get().notifications.filter(n => !n.read).length
    }),
    { name: 'app-store' }
  ))
)

```

This pattern is very practical in large projects and can significantly reduce maintenance costs.

## Real-World Applications

Usage in real projects tends to be more complex:

```javascript
import { useRef, useEffect, useState } from 'react'

function useIntersectionObserver(options = {}) {
  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(false)
  const ref = useRef(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    const observer = new IntersectionObserver(([entry]) => {
      setIsVisible(entry.isIntersecting)
    }, { threshold: 0.1, ...options })
    const el = ref.current
    if (el) observer.observe(el)
    return () => { if (el) observer.unobserve(el) }
  }, [])

  return [ref, isVisible]
}

```

Through this approach, both the testability and scalability of the code are improved.

## Optimization Tips

Here is a complete example:

```javascript
import { useReducer, useCallback } from 'react'

const initialState = { items: [], filter: '', sort: 'date' }

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'SET_ITEMS': return { ...state, items: action.payload }
    case 'SET_FILTER': return { ...state, filter: action.payload }
    case 'ADD_ITEM': return { ...state, items: [...state.items, action.payload] }
    case 'REMOVE_ITEM': return { ...state, items: state.items.filter(i => i.id !== action.payload) }
    default: throw new Error(`Unknown: ${action.type}`)
  }
}

```

Pay attention to boundary condition handling, which is critical in production environments.

## Summary

- Code examples are for reference only and need to be adjusted according to your business scenario
- React 19: useActionState for Form State is not a silver bullet; choose based on your project scale and tech stack
- Understanding underlying principles is more important than memorizing APIs
