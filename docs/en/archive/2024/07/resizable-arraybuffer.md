The topic of Resizable ArrayBuffer Performance Optimization has been discussed many times in the community, but with each new version, many conclusions need updating. This article revisits it based on the latest version.

## Getting Started

Let's start with the basic implementation:

```javascript
const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  for (const entry of list.getEntries()) {
    if (entry.entryType === 'largest-contentful-paint') {
      reportMetric('LCP', entry.startTime)
    }
    if (entry.entryType === 'first-input') {
      reportMetric('FID', entry.processingStart - entry.startTime)
    }
  }
})
observer.observe({ entryTypes: ['largest-contentful-paint', 'first-input'] })

```

This code demonstrates the basic usage. In real projects, you also need to consider error handling and edge cases.

## Source Code Analysis

Building on this foundation, we can further optimize:

```javascript
const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  for (const entry of list.getEntries()) {
    if (entry.entryType === 'largest-contentful-paint') {
      reportMetric('LCP', entry.startTime)
    }
    if (entry.entryType === 'first-input') {
      reportMetric('FID', entry.processingStart - entry.startTime)
    }
  }
})
observer.observe({ entryTypes: ['largest-contentful-paint', 'first-input'] })

```

This pattern is very practical in large projects and can significantly reduce maintenance costs.

## Real-World Applications

Usage in real projects tends to be more complex:

```javascript
const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  for (const entry of list.getEntries()) {
    if (entry.entryType === 'largest-contentful-paint') {
      reportMetric('LCP', entry.startTime)
    }
    if (entry.entryType === 'first-input') {
      reportMetric('FID', entry.processingStart - entry.startTime)
    }
  }
})
observer.observe({ entryTypes: ['largest-contentful-paint', 'first-input'] })

```

Through this approach, both the testability and scalability of the code are improved.

## Optimization Tips

Here is a complete example:

```javascript
const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  for (const entry of list.getEntries()) {
    if (entry.entryType === 'largest-contentful-paint') {
      reportMetric('LCP', entry.startTime)
    }
    if (entry.entryType === 'first-input') {
      reportMetric('FID', entry.processingStart - entry.startTime)
    }
  }
})
observer.observe({ entryTypes: ['largest-contentful-paint', 'first-input'] })

```

Pay attention to boundary condition handling, which is critical in production environments.

## Summary

- In team collaboration, conventions and documentation are more important than the technology itself
- Stay updated with the community, technical solutions need continuous iteration
- Don't adopt new technology just for the sake of it
