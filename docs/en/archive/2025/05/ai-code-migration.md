AI code migration and refactoring tools are becoming increasingly common in day-to-day development. This article offers a systematic look at their usage, inner workings, and optimization strategies.

## Quick Start

We can improve it in the following way:

```javascript
"use client";
import { useChat } from "ai/react";

export function AIChat() {
  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit, isLoading } =
    useChat({
      api: "/api/chat",
    });
  return (
    <div className="chat-container">
      {messages.map((m) => (
        <div key={m.id} className={`message ${m.role}`}>
          <p>{m.content}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input value={input} onChange={handleInputChange} />
        <button type="submit" disabled={isLoading}>
          发送
        </button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This approach has been running stably in production for over six months and has been battle-tested.

## Under the Hood

Let's start by looking at the basic implementation:

```javascript
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { streamText } from "ai";

export async function POST(req) {
  const { messages } = await req.json();
  const result = await streamText({
    model: openai("gpt-4o"),
    messages,
    system: "你是一个专业的前端开发助手。",
    maxTokens: 2000,
  });
  return result.toDataStreamResponse();
}
```

This snippet illustrates the fundamental usage. In real projects you'll also need to account for error handling and edge cases.

## Business Practice

Building on this foundation, we can further optimize:

```javascript
"use client";
import { useChat } from "ai/react";

export function AIChat() {
  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit, isLoading } =
    useChat({
      api: "/api/chat",
    });
  return (
    <div className="chat-container">
      {messages.map((m) => (
        <div key={m.id} className={`message ${m.role}`}>
          <p>{m.content}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input value={input} onChange={handleInputChange} />
        <button type="submit" disabled={isLoading}>
          发送
        </button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This pattern is very practical in large-scale projects and can significantly reduce maintenance costs.

## Performance Comparison

In a real project, the usage gets a bit more complex:

```javascript
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { streamText } from "ai";

export async function POST(req) {
  const { messages } = await req.json();
  const result = await streamText({
    model: openai("gpt-4o"),
    messages,
    system: "你是一个专业的前端开发助手。",
    maxTokens: 2000,
  });
  return result.toDataStreamResponse();
}
```

Performance optimization must be tailored to specific scenarios—not every situation calls for aggressive optimization.

## Summary

- Always verify compatibility before using in production
- In team collaboration, conventions and documentation matter more than the technology itself
- Stay up-to-date with community trends; technical solutions require continuous iteration
